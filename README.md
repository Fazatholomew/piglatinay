## Assigmnent
  Create an industrial-strength piglatin translator program within a group then present it to the class.

</br>

## Installation
  Clone this repo:
  <code>
  git clone https://github.com/Fazatholomew/piglatinay.git
  </code>
  
  In local repo's cloned folder, run the program in python:
  <code>
  python test.py
  </code>
  
</br>
  
## Research
  We tried to find the simplest rules of Piglatin. Since Piglatin is not an official term or language, such exact rule does not exist. We end up using rules from this https://www.onehourtranslation.com/translation/blog/how-speak-pig-latin as we thought the simplest. The final rules are based on our decision to fulfill the assignment.
  
</br>

## Rules
  * Words Beginning with a Consonant: Love > ovelay
  * Words Beginning with a Vowel: I > iyay
  * Words Containing the Letter ‘Y’: You > ouyay or Mystery > ysterymay
  * Sentences Containing Punctuation: I love you. > iyay ovelay ouyay.
  * Sentences Containing Number: I love: 1.you, 2.bacon, 3.coke. > iyay ovelay: 1.ouyay, 2.aconbay, 3.okecay.
  
</br>

## Progress
  * February 8: Simple words and sentences are successfully converted. The program follows 1st and 2nd rules.
